# Project1

In the spring 2021, I took the course TMA4320 Introduction to Scientific Computation. The course consists of two equal parts: theoretical and practical/computational. The theoretical part of the course introduces the participants to numerical mathematics and prepares them for the scientific computing part. The latter consists of three compulsory projects originating from physics, biophysics and mathematics. All three project is done by me and another person, whose name is held confidential. 

This is the first project, and it is closely related to physics. In this project, we look at a simplified, one-dimensional model of the ocean, and study how CO_{2} is
absorbed at the surface, dissolved in the water, and transported down to greater depths by diffusion. Based on this model we simulate the total absorption of CO_{2} in the ocean the next 10 years. 

The file named Project1Description.pdf contains the description of the the project.

The file named Project1.ipynb is the submitted paper, but without the optional testcases described in Appendix A in the project description. Please contct me if you would like to have the original paper, where the testcases is included. All the results and plots are visible, so there is no need to run the code to read the project.
